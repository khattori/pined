<h2>A Proxy Server Through Firewall</h2>
<h1>Pined version 0.0.1</h1>

<p>
Pined is a proxy server to enables to access a private server inside a
firewall.
</p>

<p>
In your server application, replace socket API call, such as bind and
accept, into wrapper call (provided in libpinesock) for these APIs so
that the server register its listening port to an Pined. The Pined
will create a server socket behalf of the server in a private
network. The Pined relays a connection to the private sever when a
client connect to the Pined.
</p>

<p>
A typical use of pined is as follows:

<h3>Example</h3>

The following example program illustrates the use of pined library
in typical server application.
<pre>
	// create a socket for listening
	so = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

	// set psaddr to the address of pined
	memset(&psaddr, 0, sizeof psaddr);
	psaddr.sin_family      = AF_INET;
	psaddr.sin_port        = htons(8888);
	psaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = pserver_ipaddr;

	// requet to pined to bind socket with port 10000
	ps_bind(so, 10000, (struct sockaddr *)&psaddr, sizeof psaddr);

	// request to listen
	ps_listen(so, SOMAXCONN);

	// wait connection from client
	cso = ps_accept(so, NULL, NULL);

	// serve for client
	read(cso,...)
	...
</pre>
