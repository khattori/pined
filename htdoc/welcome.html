<p>
Pined is a proxy server to enables to access a private server inside a
firewall.
</p>

<p>
In your server application, replace socket API call, such as bind and
accept, into wrapper call (provided in librssock) for these APIs so
that the server register its listening port to an Pined. The Pined
will create a server socket behalf of the server in a private
network. The Pined relays a connection to the private sever when a
client connect to the Pined.
